        <h3>Lisa Montalvo</h3>
        <p>Great price! I had a flex pipe issue that other shops quoted over $1 000. Mufflers For Less diagnosed it, completed the job in under an hour and charged only $107. Friendly, honest and highly recommended!</p>

        <h3>Daniel Burrow</h3>
        <p>I have always received fair and honest service and prices. I have referred countless people, and not one has ever said anything negative but always thanked me for referring them to Mufflers For Less. These guys are honestly good people – fast and fair. I won’t go anywhere else. I only wish more businesses were run like them.</p>

        <h3>Emma K</h3>
        <p>Excellent service and even better price! I needed a new muffler and went to a different place and got quoted $700 because of how it broke. Came here and was told a new muffler would be $169 + tax. I ended up forgetting about the appointment and realised at 2:20; they still fit me in and, after looking at it, said it would only be $79 + tax and showed me where it was broke and the different options I had!</p>

        <h3>Mike Konesky</h3>
        <p>Had a 9 a.m. appointment today to replace a flex pipe. Vehicle was on the rack and finished by 9:30. Very pleasant experience. No upsell on other items. Very reasonable price. I highly recommend and will definitely be a return customer.</p>

        <h3>Shawniece Adams</h3>
        <p>So I take my car to get a missing resonator put on… they could have just done the resonator and sent me on my way but no! They tell me that the missing part isn’t the issue – it’s my cracked flex pipe. They repaired the flex pipe and everything feels so much better! The acceleration, the sound, the smells… it just feels like a completely different car now. I’m still going to come back to get the resonator but they took the time to make sure that it was actually a problem instead of just replacing the part. Really appreciate them more than they know!</p>

        <h3>Marianne Goldweber</h3>
        <p>I would highly recommend this local business. This was such a wonderful experience. I thought it was going to cost me a fortune. They did a great repair for me today that didn't break the bank! So grateful… was in and out of there within an hour. Everyone was so kind and professional!</p>

        <h3>James Barnwell</h3>
        <p>Excellent service. Stopped in and got a quote which seemed reasonable. After checking with a few other places I came back to make an appointment the following day at 1:15 p.m. Due to the weather that day I ended up getting there earlier than the appointment; they managed to still get me in and did amazing work. Taylor and the tech Hector did amazing work. The car is quieter now than it ever was when I first got it 4 years ago. I highly recommend this place. They care about making it reasonable for you. Thumbs up everyone!</p>

        <h3>Craig Reed</h3>
        <p>I came here via a referral from my regular auto mechanic and it turns out these guys are great. We repaired what we could repair and replaced only what we had to. If I ever need exhaust work done again I would absolutely come back to these guys.</p>
